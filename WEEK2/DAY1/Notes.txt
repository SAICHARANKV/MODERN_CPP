FIRST CLASS FUNCTIONS:

1) Every function has a type(its signature)

2) Function can be passed as a parameter to other functions

3) Functions can be returned from other functions

4) Functions address can be captured in a variable

5) Functions can be stored in containers.

Functions should not be written as global as it makes code complicated
to solve this issue using lambda.

lambda functions are anynomous functions
They are like objects
They allow to control scope and life.

lambda function automatically in internal with a class member function
