Rule of 0 : As long as possible do not implement any special member function
like default constructor ,move constructor unneccessarly, unless u get a requirment
to modify. Leave as they are.

Rule of 3: If any way u change destructor.Then, U need to must change
copy constructor,copy assignment

Rule of 5: If u follow rule of 3 , and also want move constructor and move assignment
define them too in own way.

If "COPY constructor" with "MOVE constructor" cannot be available and vice versa.So, that is why compiler do not
provide copy with move constructor.
