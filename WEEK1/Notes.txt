1) defaulted & deleted member functions
    : You can explicitly specify what is enabled vs disabled

2) Constructor delegation
    : Transfer control from one constructor another of the same class to 
    use "chaining of constructors" to fully construct an object. It can 
    avoid duplicated initialization code.

3) Explicit Keyword
    : prevents a constructor with only 1 "Unknown/NON-default" parameter
    to be used for implicit type conversion.

4) Introduction  to smart pointers
    : scope based resource management for handling pointer deallocation
    "smartly"

5) using Keyword
    : creates an  alternate name/alias for some type

6) auto Keyword
    : allows for inferring or deducing type of a variable based on initial
    value.

7) Uniform initialization
    : one common syntactical way of initializing everything

8) nullptr
    : replacement of NULL macro with a proper type (std::nullptr)
